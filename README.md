## It’s time to say goodbye

I'd like to thank everyone who's downloaded, used, and contributed to Another Widget! I've truly appreciated the love and support this project has received.

This repository will be archived. This means the code will remain available for reference, but there won't be any further development or official support.

Thanks again for being part of the Another Widget community!

With gratitude,  
Tommaso Berlose - The Another Widget Developer


Another Widget
========

Another Widget intelligently summarizes the information you need most.
Watch the next events, the weather, and the information you want in an intuitive and elegant way. (Nope, reminders cannot be displayed because it's not allowed.)

While respecting the design of the application, there is a great opportunity to customize the information displayed and widget components.
Also, as much as possible, there are always updates and new features in the short run.

Help me developing with feedback and support me on how you can.
